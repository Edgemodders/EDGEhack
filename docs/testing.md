# <span class="y">Tests</span>

Every test run on EDGEhack: how to run it again, what to expect, and what it showed. Each phase ends with a hand test by the owner ([design, "Phases"](design.html#phases)); new tests are added here when they are first run, and their later runs' results too.

Last updated 2026-11-04.

## At a glance

| Test | Kind | Phase | Last run | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Type check, build and unit tests](#type-check-build-and-unit-tests) | Automated, also on GitHub (Check) | H0 | 2026-11-04 | Pass, 3 tests |
| Quickhack names against game 2.5 | By script, read only | H0 | 2026-11-04 | All 92 quickhack items read: 18 families a player sees and the Cyberdeck item; 7 internal items with other names left out, as they should be |

## Waiting for a hand test

None yet. H0's check is the owner's review of the design.

## Type check, build and unit tests

```powershell
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm test
```

The **Check** workflow runs the same on every push to `main`. The tests are pure: no VS Code and no game.
